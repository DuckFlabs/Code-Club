            This is a bunch of stuff I randomly typed up to fill some space (it's about dolphins).

            Dolphins are a widely distributed and diverse group of fully aquatic marine animals. They are an informal grouping withint the order
            Cetacea, excluding whales and porpoises, so to zoologists the grouping is paraphyletic. The dolphins comprise the extent families
            Delphinidae (the oceanic dolphins), Platanistidae(the Indian river dolphines), Iniidae (the new world river dolphins), and Pontoporiidae (the brackish dolphins).

            Dolphins range in size from the 1.7-metre-long (5.6 ft) long and 50 kg (110 lb) Maui's dolphin to the 9.5 m (31 ft) and 10 t (11 short tons) killer whale. Several species exhibit sexual
            dimorphism, in that the males are larger than females. They have streamlined bodies and two limbs that are modified into flippers. Though not quite as flexible as seals, some dolphins can
            travel at 55.5 kilometres per hour (34.5 mph). Dolphins use their conical shaped teeth to capture fast moving prey. They have well-developed hearing—their hearing, which is adapted for
            both air and water, is so well developed that some can survive even if they are blind. Some species are well adapted for diving to great depths. They have a layer of fat, or blubber, under
            the skin to keep warm in the cold water.
